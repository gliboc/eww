This project is being written by Guillaume Duboc.

Its aim is to build a distributed hash table using a ring-shaped topology
of erlang nodes.

## Usage

### Dependencies

This code uses https://github.com/avtobiff/erlang-uuid, which is imported and compiled 
using `rebar3`. `rebar3` is downloaded automatically from `https://s3.amazonaws.com/rebar3/rebar3` when you launch `make` for the first time. This link is given at https://github.com/erlang/rebar3 and contains the latest compiled version for `rebar3`. 

### Client

Compile the modules using `make`. This will output the compiled code to the different `ebin/`
directories inside `_build/`. 

Then, type `make run` to start an erlang shell which imports this code, and use the defined functions
to spawn and manage a topology of nodes.

### Constellation of devices

In order to showcase the use of this program, I would like to create a list
of wired devices that would run the agent and constitute a shared data system 
between me and some friends that could host similar devices.

A list of such devices can be found in `devices.txt`. At some points, the 
client will be able to read into this file and spawn agents on the diffent
nodes of the topology.

The current list contains only one device :
- Raspberry Zero W

### Documentation

You can generate a basic documentation with `make doc`, but this is not very helpful yet. The `todo.md` file is less structured, but it gives an overview of the features of the project, and which functions tackle them particularly.

After some time, the information inside `todo.md` should be converted to the generated doc.

## Architecture

### Agent

The `agent.erl` module contains all the functions for spawning a topology with
listening agents. The supported operations on the agents are :
	
- `kill` : kill a specific node and reshape the ring. It also makes the target node give all its (key, data) pairs to its next peer.

- `destroy` : destruct all the nodes

- `join` / `new_node` : spawn a node and make it join the topology

- `ping` : pass a ping through the network. The ping stores a lot of information that it gathers along its path, such as the number of nodes, the list of keys kept in the network, or the number of messages exchanged. If a ping ends correctly, it means that the whole system is sound.

## Communication system

### Topology

This application uses a ring-shaped topology that is mostly uni-directionnal. Each node is constantly linked with one peer, but can establish direct connections with the client when transferring data.

The nodes communicate with four different type of message :
	
- commands `{cmd, Cmd, Ref}`
- packets `{pack, Msg, Ref}`
- data streams `{data, Msg, Ref}`
- acknowledgements `{ack, Ref}`

The main difference between `commands` and `packets` are that commands can be 
adressed to a single node of the network whereas packets should run through
the entire network.

The `Id` is a hash of the node's Pid and processor time obtained with `now()`.
It is used to check if a message was received before.

`acknowledgements`, though not implemented yet, should be used in order to confirm
no messages were lost, and eventually to detect that a node is sleeping/dead.

### Detecting failure

In order to detect failing nodes, I had two main ideas :

- implement an acknowledgement system where each communication would receive a confirmation. If a node doesn't acknowledge, 
- after some time, it is considered dead/sleeping
- implement periodic checks :
    - local checks, where a node checks on its neighboor
    - global checks, where an elected node passes a token through the ring and launches a restructuration if the token doesn't go through

Before implementing, I decided that I prefered the latter option. In the first option, the number of acknowledgements would scale linearly with the number of API calls, and I don't think that's a good thing.



## Analysis and testing

### Type checking

This code is type-checked using `dialyzer`, which you can do by calling `make dialyzer`, provided `dialyzer` was initialized on your system.

### Tests

There are modules being build with the names `?MODULE_tests.erl` in order to test the most important functions in the app. For example, `transfer_tests.erl` tests the data transfer and other features.
